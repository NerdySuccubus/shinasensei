            <h3>COURSES</h3>
            <br>
            <p>If you're here you've probably heard of my courses! We go in depth from all the topics seen
                on Tik Tok and Youtube videos. <br><br>
                Every lesson has many exercises for you to able to practise what you see on videos and store the knowledge. <br>
                Forget about the textbook approach, all the content in this course was created by me from scratch!
                Following a program that's intuitive and just makes sense. <br><br>
                Whether it's for fun or to bump that cv, the course will allow you to communicate 
                and understand your favorite shows in a pretty good time. As always, practise is key!

            <h3>VIDEOS</h3>
            <br>
            <p>I specialize in the creation of multimedia content for different platforms, mostly TikTok & Youtube. 
                Teaching Japanese is only one of my many hobbies and hustles! 
                <br><br>
                I love learning languages, so I figured 
                why not share what I’ve learned after some good years with this language and after living in Japan for three years. <br> <br>
                I’ve found that learning through videos is the most dynamic way to study, so most of the content will be in that format. I also offer even more content in my courses and on my Patreon Page!

            <h3>ARTICLES</h3>
            <br>
            <p>I have a monthly newsletter available for my Patreon supporters where I tell stories, a mix of my experiences while living in Japan and travelling a bit of the world 
                and some advice of what I’ve taken from those experiences. <br><br>
                The Mini-books are little, but resourceful, compilations of many topics that will help you learn the language
                 and many aspects of Japanese culture (Vocabulary, grammar, study tips & more). 
                 <br><br>
                I really believe they can add a lot of value to your learning experience together with all the video content I have available for free on many platforms.
